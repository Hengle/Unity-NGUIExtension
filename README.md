Unity-NGUIExtension
===================

Various NGUI extension modules.

Modules
-------
* **UIShaderSprite** - It enables to apply and specify shader on each of sprite in the atlas. (It will work on NGUI 3.7.0 or higher version)

* **Alpha Masked shader** - It enables to use compressed image format for an Atlas image file, PVRTC on iOS and ETC on Android. Both of format are 4bits so it reduces image size to 1/4. Inspired by [unity-alphamask](https://github.com/keijiro/unity-alphamask).
